## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- A proof of experience platform creating experienced Blockchain, Metaverse and Cyber Security engineers
- Luster network is a proof of experience platform training engineers in the field of Blockchain, Metaverse and Cyber Security and 
supplying them to companies.
- We will train live our developers to work on Polkadot ecosystem and will supply them to companies.
- We are building a platform where we teach various technologies to engineers. So, we would also like create more Polkadot engineers.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- We are developing the platform using NodeJS, ReactJS, MongoDB
- Visit MVP: https://poc.luster.network (Designs/Mockups)
- We are building platform using NodeJS, ReactJS, MongoDB, etc.
- We are exploring Blockchains for building our Proof of experience platform DApp.
- We teach Rust, Substrate, Solidity-Ethereum, Hyperledger, Metaverse, etc.
- We have completed 5 cohorts and 33 workshops by training 1300+ students.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - We will cover education part and talent providing part for the Polkadot ecosystem
  - We will cover 3 major cohorts this year by upskilling 300 students
  - We will not conduct longer cohorts (duration: 1 month max)
  - We will not add more than 5 free projects on Polkadot on Proof of Experience platform


Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Polkadot ecosystem needs a good amount of trained developers to grow. Luster can play major role.
- Developers and Businesses in Polkadot ecosystem
- We supply trained Polkadot developers to Polkadot startups
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - Yes, but we train and supply them to startups. They just train for the sake of training

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- I have already shared a github repo. Beta version is under development for product. We will make it public once it is developed.
- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/docs/RFPs) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.
      
> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
